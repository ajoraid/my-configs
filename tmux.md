# Tmux Config

Although the tmux config is typically located elsewhere, Iâ€™ve included it in this repository (alongside my Neovim config) for easier access and quicker reference.

```
set -g mouse on
set -g base-index 1
set -g pane-base-index 1
set -g prefix C-a
set -g status-right "El Psy Kongroo | %Y-%m-%d %H:%M"
```
